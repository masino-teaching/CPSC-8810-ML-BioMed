## Description
This repository includes the in class practicums and take-home assignments created as ipython notebooks.

This course will provide an introduction to supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods in 
the context of biomedical applications. Topics will include (1) supervised regression and classification 
methods such as linear and logistic regression, tree-based ensembles, and neural networks; (2)
unsupervised learning methods such as principal component analysis and clustering; (3) feature 
selection, model selection, hyperparameter tuning using deterministic and Bayesian methods, and 
model performance evaluation. Special considerations related to sparse, missing, and multimodal 
data frequently found in biomedical applications and their impact on machine learning model design, 
implementation, and performance will be presented. Time permitting, generative models and the role 
of healthcare delivery science for machine learning model deployment will also be discussed. The
presented methods and their biomedical applications will be illustrated using the Python programming 
language.
